            On November 30, 2022, Open AI released Chat GPT, the most powerful AI agent
            created up to that date. This breakthrough marked a pivotal moment in the
            history of artificial intelligence, setting new benchmarks for what AI could
            achieve. Since then, the digital landscape has changed dramatically. With
            the rapid advancement and proliferation of AI technologies, the number and
            usability of AI website builders have surged, leading to significant
            transformations in how we interact with the digital world. As AI has become
            more integrated into various aspects of technology, the World Wide Web has
            consolidated, and concerns around privacy have intensified, with personal
            data becoming increasingly vulnerable.
